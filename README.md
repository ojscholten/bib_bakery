# bib_bakery
Bake &lt;a> tags linking the urls of your bib file entries into their titles (useful for jeckyll-scholar)!

See an example of why this is useful [here](https://drscotthawley.github.io/blog/2020/07/01/Citations-Via-Bibtex.html) - see that the references at the bottom are hyperlinks to the each entry!

***open the notebook to see how to get it working!***
